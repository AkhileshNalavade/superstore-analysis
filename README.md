# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Superstore sales data to uncover trends in revenue and profitability across time, regions, and product categories. The goal is to identify business insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis focuses not only on sales performance but also on profit behavior, highlighting cases where high revenue does not necessarily translate into high profit.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains order-level transactional data with the following fields:

- **order_date** – Date of the order
- **region** – Sales region
- **category** – Product category
- **sub_category** – Product sub-category
- **sales** – Revenue generated from the order
- **profit** – Profit earned from the order

## Key Analysis Performed
- Converted order dates into datetime format for time-based analysis
- Created monthly aggregates to analyze sales and profit trends
- Compared regional performance based on total sales and profit
- Evaluated category-wise profitability
- Identified loss-making orders to highlight pricing or cost issues
- Visualized trends using line charts and bar charts

---

## Key Insights
- Sales growth does not always correlate with profit growth
- The Technology category contributes the highest overall profit
- Certain regions generate strong revenue but require cost optimization
- Loss-making orders indicate potential discounting or pricing inefficiencies
- Monthly trend analysis helps identify seasonal business patterns

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and visualization can be used to derive meaningful business insights from raw transactional data. The project emphasizes profit-focused analysis rather than revenue alone, which is critical for real-world business decision-making.
